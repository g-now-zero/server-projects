# Server Projects

This repository serves as a door to my personal server projects, including the Windows 2019 server active directory and osTicket hosted on a LAMP stack. 

The projects included in this repository are designed to help you learn more about server administration and management, and to provide you with a deeper understanding of how servers work.

If you have any questions about the projects included in this repository, or if you would like to collaborate on a server project of your own, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope you find the server projects included here to be both informative and useful!
